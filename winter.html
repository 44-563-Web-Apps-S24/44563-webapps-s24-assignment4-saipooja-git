    <p class="speech"> What happened? Come on, tell us!</p>

    <h5 class="LUBOV">LUBOV.</h5>
    <p class="speech">Is the cherry orchard sold?</p>

    <p class="speech">It is sold.</p>

    <h5 class="LUBOV">LUBOV.</h5>
    <p>Who bought it?</p>

    <p class="speech">I bought it.</p>

    <p class="direction">[LUBOV ANDREYEVNA is overwhelmed; she would fall if she were not
        standing by an armchair and a table. VARYA takes her keys off her belt,
        throws them on the floor, into the middle of the room and goes out.] </p>

    <h5 class="LOPAKHIN">LOPAKHIN.</h5>
    <p class="speech"> bought it! Wait, ladies and gentlemen, please, my head's
        going round, I can't talk....</p>
    <p class="direction">[Laughs]</p>
    <p class="speech">When we got to the sale,
        Deriganov was there already. Leonid Andreyevitch had only fifteen
        thousand roubles, and Deriganov offered thirty thousand on top of the
        mortgage to begin with. I saw how matters were, so I grabbed hold of
        him and bid forty. He went up to forty-five, I offered fifty-five. That
        means he went up by fives and I went up by tens.... Well, it came to
        an end. I bid ninety more than the mortgage; and it stayed with me. The
        cherry orchard is mine now, mine!</p>
    <p class="direction">[Roars with laughter]</p>
    <p class="speech">My God, my God,
        the cherry orchard's mine! Tell me I'm drunk, or mad, or dreaming....</p>

    <p class="direction"> [Stamps his feet]</p>
    <p class="speech">Don't laugh at me! If my father and grandfather rose
        from their graves and looked at the whole affair, and saw how their
        Ermolai, their beaten and uneducated Ermolai, who used to run barefoot
        in the winter, how that very Ermolai has bought an estate, which is
        the most beautiful thing in the world! I've bought the estate where my
        grandfather and my father were slaves, where they weren't even allowed
        into the kitchen. I'm asleep, it's only a dream, an illusion.... It's
        the fruit of imagination, wrapped in the fog of the unknown.... [Picks
        up the keys, nicely smiling] She threw down the keys, she wanted to show
        she was no longer mistress here....</p>
    <p class="direction">[Jingles keys]</p>
    <p class=" speech">Well, it's all one!</p>
    <p class="direction"> [Hears the band tuning up] </p>
    <p class="speech"> musicians, play, I want to hear you! Come
        and look at Ermolai Lopakhin laying his axe to the cherry orchard,
        come and look at the trees falling! We'll build villas here, and our
        grandsons and great-grandsons will see a new life here.... Play on,
        music!</p>
    <p class="direction">[The band plays. LUBOV ANDREYEVNA sinks into a chair and weeps
        bitterly. LOPAKHIN continues reproachfully]</p>
    <p class="speech">Why then, why didn't you
        take my advice? My poor, dear woman, you can't go back now.</p>
    <p class="direction">[Weeps]</p>
    <p class="speech">only the whole thing was done with, if only our uneven, unhappy lifewere changed!</p>
    <h5 class="PISCHIN">PISCHIN.</h5>
    <p class="direction">[Takes his arm; in an undertone]</p>
    <p class="speech">She's crying. Let's go into
        the drawing-room and leave her by herself... come on....</p>
    <p class="direction">[Takes his arm and leads him out.]</p>

    <h5 class="LOPAKHIN">LOPAKHIN.</h5>
    <p class="speech">What's that? Bandsmen, play nicely! Go on, do just as I want
        you to! </p>
    <p class="direction">[Ironically]</p>
    <p class="speech">The new owner, the owner of the cherry orchard is
        coming!</p>
    <p class="direction"> [He accidentally knocks up against a little table and nearly
        upsets the candelabra]</p>
    <p class="speech"> I can pay for everything!</p>
    <p class="direction">[Exit with PISCHIN]</p>

    <p class="direction"> [In the reception-room and the drawing-room nobody remains except LUBOV
        ANDREYEVNA, who sits huddled up and weeping bitterly. The band plays
        softly. ANYA and TROFIMOV come in quickly. ANYA goes up to her
        mother and goes on her knees in front of her. TROFIMOV stands at the
        drawing-room entrance.]</p>

    <h5 class="ANYA">ANYA.</h5>
    <p>Mother! mother, are you crying? My dear, kind, good mother, my
        beautiful mother, I love you! Bless you! The cherry orchard is sold,
        we've got it no longer, it's true, true, but don't cry mother, you've
        still got your life before you, you've still your beautiful pure soul...
        Come with me, come, dear, away from here, come! We'll plant a new
        garden, finer than this, and you'll see it, and you'll understand, and
        deep joy, gentle joy will sink into your soul, like the evening sun, and
        you'll smile, mother! Come, dear, let's go! Curtain.</p>
